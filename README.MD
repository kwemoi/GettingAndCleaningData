# Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

 for the 'Getting and Cleaning Data' course
  of 'Data Science Specialization' specialization.

#### By Yiannis Manatos, Feb 1 2016

This project uses data from user activity using a smartphone accelerometer data.
Reference:
  - http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

    
## The dataset includes the following files:

- 'README.MD' (this file)

- 'codebook.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'tidy_data.txt': A tidy data set as per the requirements provided.

- 'run_analysis.R': R script used to produce the tidy data set.

- 'getdata_projectfiles_UCI HAR Dataset': Input data used.


## 'run_analysis.R' R script

  The R script performs the following steps:

  1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set
     with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. R
     source code with all routines for the analysis.

## tidy_data.txt

 Output data as request on step 5.
